**Meal-Sharing and Social Network Formation**

Blog Post 1

In seventy-one percent of societies worldwide, women move to the area where her husband and his kin live at the time of marriage (Murdock 1967). I seek to evaluate how women’s ability to enter social networks after moving to a new village for marriage affects their mental health and integration into social and financial networks in rural Malawi villages. While a growing literature shows mental health disorders and loneliness are highly prevalent among low-income people, including within developing countries (Banerjee et al. 2023), there is limited evidence documenting causal pathways and mitigating strategies in this population. Furthermore, although evidence documents that social networks facilitate financial risk-sharing and information transmission (Breza et al. 2019), little is known about how social networks originate or evolve. My intervention will help young, low-income female marriage migrants to initiate meal-sharing with other women, a common way to engage socially. My study design will allow me to understand the causes and consequences of sparse and homophilic networks within a socially isolated and vulnerable population. I will explore the roles of social frictions and budget constraints as potential inhibitors of homophilic and non-homophilic network formation among young female marriage migrants. Finally, I will investigate how encouraging meal-sharing relationship affects social network formation and characteristics, psychological well-being, and socio-economic inclusion.

I am conducting a three-month randomized controlled trial in Malawi, which includes two intervention arms that each attempt to solve barriers to meal-sharing: a food price subsidy to solve budgetary concerns, and information about who else in the village would like to share meals to solve social concerns, such as fear that an invitation might be rejected. I will first recruit a sample of 2,600 women who moved to the village after the age of 14 but no more than 20 years ago (Baseline Sample). I will select a 1,600-person subset of the Baseline Sample for the intervention (Intervention Sample), selected if they have a straw roof (proxy for low-income). I will offer Baseline Sample participants who are not selected for the Intervention Sample the opportunity to add their name to a list of women who are interested in sharing meals with other women in the village more often (Sharing List). The rest of the study will be conducted with the Intervention Sample, who will be randomized into three groups:

1.	Sharing Information (n=600) – This group will view ten names from the Sharing List and can invite up to five women on the list to share a meal (invitation delivered by enumerators).

2.	Vouchers + Sharing Information (n=600) – Recipients will receive 7 USD/month (8% median monthly income) vouchers, redeemable at several local vendors selling perishable produce, and the Sharing Information intervention.

3.	Control (n=400) – This group will not receive any intervention.

	Within treatments 1 and 2, participants view one of three types of Sharing Lists: all low-SES (homophilic), all high-SES (non-homophilic), or a random selection of women. While cross-social-class friendships are highly correlated with economic mobility in the United States (Chetty et al. 2022), economists know little about the causal impacts of these relationships, catalysts to forming these relationships, and the nature of these relationships in developing countries. This second-stage randomization allows me to compare the consequences of cross-SES interactions relative to within-SES, and the ability higher-quality foods (Vouchers) to facilitate these relationships. 
	
	Furthermore, this design allows me to test if homophily is caused by preferences or constraints. Homophily -- or like-seeking-like -- is, in my setting, equivalent to within-SES relationship. If individuals have a strict preference for spending time with people within their own socio-economic status, then the opportunity to invite high-SES individuals *in addition to* the opportunity to invite low-SES individuals should not change people's preferences relative to the condition when women only have the opportunity to invite low-SES women. In other words, invitation choices in the random-selection-list condition should look no different from choices in the low-SES-list condition. Conversely, if individuals have a strict preference for cross-SES relationships, then they find themselves in homophilic relationships because they are constrained from entering cross-SES relationships. If the invitation lits and the voucher are sufficient to overcome these constraints, then invitation choices in the random-selection-list condition should look no different from choices in the high-SES-list condition (in the Voucher group).
