    <p>This study examines complementarities between experiential and social learning in health technology adoption. We engage 1800 households in peri-urban Pakistan in a field experiment on water chlorination. Our experiment has four arms: control households, who receive no intervention; households who receive free chlorine tablets; households who receive tablets and small daily financial incentives for chlorine use; and households who receive tablets and an experiential learning intervention. In the learning intervention, participants record and visually track their children's diarrhea rate relative to control households before and after chlorine distribution. While monetary incentives generate higher chlorination than experiential learning and chlorine distribution alone in the short run, these effects quickly dissipate. While there are no differential effects of the learning arm on average, learning arm households who also have a neighbor in the learning arm chlorinate their water at a significantly higher rate for almost one year after the end of the learning intervention. Households \emph{not} in the learning arm exhibit no difference in behavior by whether they have a neighbor in the learning arm. We propose a model of learning whereby ``ownership effects’’, generated by self-investment in learning and intimate knowledge of specific learning processes, give rise to a complementarity between experiential and social learning. We rule out various alternative explanations, including changing beliefs about the returns to chlorine use. The welfare implications are significant: ITT (TOT) estimates suggest that learning households with learning neighbors exhibit a 0.16 SD (0.51 SD) increase in an index of child anthropometrics after one year.
