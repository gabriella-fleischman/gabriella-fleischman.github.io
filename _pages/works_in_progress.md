    <span><strong>JOB MARKET PAPER Income-Based Homophily and Social Capital: Experimental Evidence from Malawi</strong></span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs1" class="toggle-content">
    <p>Although many studies positively associate social connections and economic outcomes, causal evidence is scarce due to endogenous link formation. I experimentally induce social interactions between female rural migrants in Malawi by facilitating low-SES women in inviting low-SES, high-SES, or a random mix of women for a shared meal. I cross-randomize a voucher for meat, a high-price `social good'. One year later, participants experience a 22% reduction in depression and a 0.13 SD increase in food consumption relative to control. While all groups experience both sets of benefits, inviting high-SES guests leads to higher consumption, while inviting low-SES guests leads to greater depression reductions. I find that effort costs prohibit women from initiating <em>any</em> relationship in the absence of the intervention, while the high price of serving meat inhibits cross-SES linking. Rather than acting as a feasibility constraint, I find that the marginal rate of substitution between low- and high-SES linking changes with the price of meat, inhibiting network economic diversity at high prices. I draw three conclusions: (1) all social relationships yield large benefits, but frictions inhibit them from forming, (2) different types of relationships are more productive across different domains, underscoring the value of economically <em>diverse</em> networks, and (3) prices reinforce income-based homophily.

    <span><strong>Experiential and Social Learning</strong> with Agha Ali Akram, Reshmaan Hussam, and Akib Khan</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs2" class="toggle-content">
    <p>This study examines complementarities between experiential and social learning in health technology adoption. We engage 1800 households in peri-urban Pakistan in a field experiment on water chlorination. Our experiment has four arms: control households, who receive no intervention; households who receive free chlorine tablets; households who receive tablets and small daily financial incentives for chlorine use; and households who receive tablets and an experiential learning intervention. In the learning intervention, participants record and visually track their children's diarrhea rate relative to control households before and after chlorine distribution. While monetary incentives generate higher chlorination than experiential learning and chlorine distribution alone in the short run, these effects quickly dissipate. While there are no differential effects of the learning arm on average, learning arm households who also have a neighbor in the learning arm chlorinate their water at a significantly higher rate for almost one year after the end of the learning intervention. Households <em>not</em> in the learning arm exhibit no difference in behavior by whether they have a neighbor in the learning arm. We propose a model of learning whereby "ownership effects", generated by self-investment in learning and intimate knowledge of specific learning processes, give rise to a complementarity between experiential and social learning. We rule out various alternative explanations, including changing beliefs about the returns to chlorine use. The welfare implications are significant: ITT (TOT) estimates suggest that learning households with learning neighbors exhibit a 0.16 SD (0.51 SD) increase in an index of child anthropometrics after one year.

  <span><strong>Distorted Signals and Evaluator Bias: A Two-Stage Experiment on Gendered Hiring in Malawi</strong> with Mansa Saxena</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs3" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
Our study examines gender gaps in hiring for formal employment in Malawi. We partner with a firm to conduct two sequential experiments to study supply-side constraints (lack of qualified female applicants) and demand-side constraints (biases in hiring decisions). The first experiment focuses on increasing the pool of female applications during a recruitment drive through female-directed advertising. Despite no differences in the objective skills of the female applicants across treated and control areas, the treatment has the perverse effect of leading to a <em>reduction</em> in female hiring. This surprising result informs our second experiment—a resume audit study—where we use real applications from stage one and manipulate application features, while holding qualifications constant, to isolate biases in hiring evaluations. We argue that the treatment backfires due to the combination of evaluator bias, where evaluators place greater weight on soft-skill signals for women, and signal distortion, whereby the treatment alters how women use soft-skill signals on their applications, thereby reducing the correlation between soft-skill signals and more-informative signals of ability. In the absence of the treatment, soft-skill signals and objective technical skills are positively correlated, allowing evaluators to select objectively qualified applicants across genders. The treatment weakens this cross-signal correlation for women, which, when combined with evaluators’ greater reliance on soft-skill cues for female applicants, leads to the screening in of less-qualified women who ultimately crowd out more-qualified candidates from the pool.
