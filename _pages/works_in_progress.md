    <span><strong>JOB MARKET PAPER Income-Based Homophily and Social Capital: Experimental Evidence from Malawi</strong></span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs1" class="toggle-content">
    <p>Although many studies positively associate social connections and economic outcomes, causal evidence is scarce due to endogenous link formation. I experimentally induce social interactions between female rural migrants in Malawi by facilitating low-SES women in inviting low-SES, high-SES, or a random mix of women for a shared meal. I cross-randomize a voucher for meat, a high-price `social good'. One year later, participants experience a 22% reduction in depression and a 0.13 SD increase in food consumption relative to control. While all groups experience both sets of benefits, inviting high-SES guests leads to higher consumption, while inviting low-SES guests leads to greater depression reductions. I find that effort costs prohibit women from initiating <em>any</em> relationship in the absence of the intervention, while the high price of serving meat inhibits cross-SES linking. Rather than acting as a feasibility constraint, I find that the marginal rate of substitution between low- and high-SES linking changes with the price of meat, inhibiting network economic diversity at high prices. I draw three conclusions: (1) all social relationships yield large benefits, but frictions inhibit them from forming, (2) different types of relationships are more productive across different domains, underscoring the value of economically <em>diverse</em> networks, and (3) prices reinforce income-based homophily.

    <span><strong>Experiential and Social Learning</strong> with Agha Ali Akram, Reshmaan Hussam, and Akib Khan</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs2" class="toggle-content">
    <p>This study examines complementarities between experiential and social learning in health technology adoption. We engage 1800 households in peri-urban Pakistan in a field experiment on water chlorination. Our experiment has four arms: control households, who receive no intervention; households who receive free chlorine tablets; households who receive tablets and small daily financial incentives for chlorine use; and households who receive tablets and an experiential learning intervention. In the learning intervention, participants record and visually track their children's diarrhea rate relative to control households before and after chlorine distribution. While monetary incentives generate higher chlorination than experiential learning and chlorine distribution alone in the short run, these effects quickly dissipate. While there are no differential effects of the learning arm on average, learning arm households who also have a neighbor in the learning arm chlorinate their water at a significantly higher rate for almost one year after the end of the learning intervention. Households <em>not</em> in the learning arm exhibit no difference in behavior by whether they have a neighbor in the learning arm. We propose a model of learning whereby "ownership effects", generated by self-investment in learning and intimate knowledge of specific learning processes, give rise to a complementarity between experiential and social learning. We rule out various alternative explanations, including changing beliefs about the returns to chlorine use. The welfare implications are significant: ITT (TOT) estimates suggest that learning households with learning neighbors exhibit a 0.16 SD (0.51 SD) increase in an index of child anthropometrics after one year.

  <span><strong>Distorted Signals and Evaluator Bias: A Two-Stage Experiment on Gendered Hiring in Malawi</strong> with Mansa Saxena</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs3" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
Our study examines gender gaps in hiring for formal employment in Malawi. We partner with a firm to conduct two sequential experiments to study supply-side constraints (lack of qualified female applicants) and demand-side constraints (biases in hiring decisions). The first experiment focuses on increasing the pool of female applications during a recruitment drive through female-directed advertising. Despite no differences in the objective skills of the female applicants across treated and control areas, the treatment has the perverse effect of leading to a <em>reduction</em> in female hiring. This surprising result informs our second experiment—a resume audit study—where we use real applications from stage one and manipulate application features, while holding qualifications constant, to isolate biases in hiring evaluations. We argue that the treatment backfires due to the combination of evaluator bias, where evaluators place greater weight on soft-skill signals for women, and signal distortion, whereby the treatment alters how women use soft-skill signals on their applications, thereby reducing the correlation between soft-skill signals and more-informative signals of ability. In the absence of the treatment, soft-skill signals and objective technical skills are positively correlated, allowing evaluators to select objectively qualified applicants across genders. The treatment weakens this cross-signal correlation for women, which, when combined with evaluators’ greater reliance on soft-skill cues for female applicants, leads to the screening in of less-qualified women who ultimately crowd out more-qualified candidates from the pool.

    <span><strong>Gendered Misallocation of Agrarian Labor</strong> with Nicholas Rahim. <em>Trial in progress</em>
</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs4" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
The gap in agricultural output between men and women has long been documented in Malawi, with the difference in productivity estimated to be 28%. Standard explanations for this productivity gap point towards disparate quality and quantity of capital farm inputs. We test a novel explanation for disparities in agricultural output between men and women in Malawi: child-bearing as a unique shock to household labor supply that inhibit women from efficiently utilizing their land and maximizing potential yields. Pregnancy and child-rearing are negative shocks to women’s available labor, since women’s time and productivity is compromised by physiological changes and child-rearing responsibilities. In frictionless land, labor, and credit markets, women should be able to make productive use of their land when their own labor supply is inhibited. We test if labor and credit market frictions prevent pregnant and postpartum women from optimally using their land. We partner with an organization that provides loans for capital farm inputs to implement a randomized controlled trial with female farmers who are pregnant or have a child under the age of one year old. We randomly select women for whom we subsidize the cost and search frictions for hiring five days of agricultural labor during the farming season. We test the impact of resolving labor and credit market frictions on agricultural and health outcomes.

<strong>Peer Effects in Adherence to HIV Treatment</strong> with Jessica Gallant. <em>Analysis</em>
</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs5" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
This paper investigates the role of peer influence in health behavior by studying antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among adolescents living with HIV in Malawi. We provide novel causal evidence of peer behaviour in determining retention in HIV care through an analysis of high-frequency electronic medical records of HIV treatment from 85 Malawian clinics. With electronic medical records of almost 45,000 adolescents, across twelve years and 23 districts in Malawi, we track high-stakes health decision-making for as long as adolescents receive care. This allows us to examine the causal impact of peer behavior on long-term health adherence among a group that is both developmentally sensitive to peer dynamics and disproportionately affected by poor health outcomes in the context of HIV.

<strong>Why do we Pay for Symbolism? Evidence from U.S. Landmark Names</strong> with Emily McDonnell. <em>Data collection in progress</em>
</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs6" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
We use administrative data and survey experiments to analyze reactions to the renaming of U.S. geographic landmarks. Using a sample of real landmark name changes and political donations in affected zip-codes, we find evidence that people are willing to pay for their preferred symbolic representation of the U.S. map, but that they respond to the name change <em>process</em> rather than the actual replacement names. In our survey experiment, respondents express much more conservative policy preferences when we frame the 2015 renaming of Mt. McKinley to Mt. Denali as a process enacted by and benefiting groups of people, rather than a passive occurrence. Emphasizing the Indigenous origins of the name "Denali" does not generate the same response, and when combined with the active voice treatment actually mitigates the backlash. We argue that part of the reason people care about symbols is because they lose utility through the processes that seek to enact, remove, or replace symbols, distinct from preferences over the symbols themselves. Crucially, tailored information can psychologically compensate people for these utility losses and reduce backlash. These findings have implications for our understanding of cultural preferences over political processes, and policy relevance for messaging about policy changes.

<strong>Public Services and Private Behavior: Evidence from Water Infrastructure in Pakistan</strong> with Akib Khan. <em>Data collection complete, analysis in progress</em>
</span>
  </div>
  <div id="abs7" class="toggle-content">
    <p>
We study how private health behavior responds to new public water infrastructure. During an 18-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) in peri-urban Karachi, we distribute chlorine tablets to households and collect monthly, objective measures of chlorine use and water source choices. Concurrently, local NGOs independently implement water infrastructure projects in a staggered fashion. This natural variation in proximity to new standpipes and boreholes, combined with randomized access to water treatment, allows us to estimate the dynamic effects of infrastructure exposure on private behavior and health outcomes.
