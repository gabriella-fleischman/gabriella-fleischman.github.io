I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. In my research, I am driven to understand the economic consequences of social and cultural inclusion of marginalized groups, especially as it relates to their health and labor market opportunities. I study these issues through the lens of development economics, health economics, and the economics of social networks.

<strong>I am on the 2025-2026 job market.</strong>

At Harvard, I am an affiliate of the Center for International Development (CID) and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS). Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action Malawi (IPA). I graduated from the University of California San Diego in 2017 with a B.S. in Joint Mathematics/Economics.
