I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. My research explores how social norms and identity influence health and health behaviors, with an emphasis on mental health and social inclusion in marginalized populations. 

At Harvard, I am an affiliate of the Center for International Development (CID) and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS). Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action Malawi (IPA). I graduated from the University of California San Diego in 2017 with a B.S. in Joint Mathematics/Economics.
