I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. I study the economic consequences of social and cultural inclusion of marginalized groups, especially as it relates to their health and labor market opportunities. My research evaluates these issues through the lens of development economics, health economics, and the economics of social networks.

I will be joining the University of Pittsburgh Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2026.

At Harvard, I am an affiliate of the Center for International Development (CID) and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS). Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action Malawi (IPA). I graduated from the University of California San Diego in 2017 with a B.S. in Joint Mathematics/Economics.
