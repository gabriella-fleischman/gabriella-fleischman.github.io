I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. I study topics in development economics, health economics, and the economics of social networks.

At Harvard, I am an affiliate of the Center for International Development (CID) and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS). Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action Malawi (IPA). I graduated from the University of California San Diego in 2017 with a B.S. in Joint Mathematics/Economics.
